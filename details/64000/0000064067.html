<p> Students encounter firsthand Vienna's rich cultural heritage of museums, theaters, operas, operettas, concerts, coffeehouses. Coursework focuses on the shift in Vienna from the late-19th-century romanticism of the declining Habsburg Empire to an unprecedented modernism in all the arts. Includes study of architecture (Loos) and music (Schonberg), as well as psychology (Freud), science (Mach), and philosophy (Wittgenstein), and the cult of death and suicide of fin-de-siècle Vienna. Offered during Interim. </p><p> </p>
