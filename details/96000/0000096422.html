It examines the nature of interaction and the role played by Africans, African culture and African institutions in the political, economic, cultural and religious life of the New World. Students explore questions such as to what extent the iconography of Africa so used to mobilize Africans in disperson, and how effective was the consciousness of Africa sustained in the New World and finally the contributions of African Americans to Africa. </p>
