<p> Second-semester music majors continue formal musicianship studies. Students perform rhythms and melodies at sight.

These topics are closely integrated into melodic and harmonic dictations. Prerequisite: MUSIC 112. Prerequisites: concurrent registration in MUSIC 162 (or placement into a higher level of keyboard proficiency). Offered annually in the spring semester. </p>
