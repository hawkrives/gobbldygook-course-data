	SWRK 246: Human Behavior in the Social Environment
	(2009-2010, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Humans relate to one another in families, groups, organizations and communities. Through social systems, cross-cultural, strengths and other theoretical perspectives, students apply prerequisite and advanced content material from biology, sociology, and psychology to assess situations encountered by social workers. Diverse examples are drawn from literature -- <i>Love in the</i> <i> Driest Season</i>, <i>The Color of Water</i>, <i>A Poison Stronger than Love</i> and from students' autobiographies. Prerequisites: Sociology 121, Psychology 241, and Biology 123 or 243; open to non-majors by permission of chair only. Offered annually in the Fall Semester. </p><p> </p>
