	PSYCH 338: Neurobiology of Psychopathology
	(2011-2012, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. In this discussion-based course, students use published research findings to examine the connections between the symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, biochemistry, and physiology. Prerequisites: Psychology 230, 247, and 238, or Neuroscience 234 or 239. Offered alternate years. </p><p> </p>
