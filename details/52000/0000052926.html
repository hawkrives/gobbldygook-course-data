	BIO 372: Developmental Biology
	(2006-2007, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The last decade has unveiled the mechanism by which a single cell gives rise to an embryo rich in pattern and cellular diversity. This course traces the use of surgical, genetic and molecular techniques as they have uncovered developmental blueprints encoding the universal body plan fundamental to all metazoan life. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 125, 126 and 233. Taught annually. </p>
