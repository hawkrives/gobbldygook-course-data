	PSYCH 236: Conditioning and Learning
	(2006-2007, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> How do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning process? While some emphasis will be on analysis of the behavioral viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students will also examine approaches to how we learn which have grown out of recent cognitive and ecological (evolutionary) perspectives in psychology. The course includes lecture and laboratory work with nonhuman animals. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. GE: NST, NSL. Offered every year. </p>
