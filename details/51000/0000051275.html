	(2006-2007, Interim)

<p> Students explore geographic, economic, political, and ethnic dimensions of life in present-day Ecuador by combining intensive course work with such cross-cultural experiences as a homestay in Quito, interactions with students, and field trips to indigenous communities in Otavalo and the Amazon region east of Tena. They consolidate their language skills and continue to develop their skills for analyzing and communicating in Spanish through compositions, oral presentations, and interviews of Ecuadorians.
