	BIO 135: Thinking and Doing Biology
	(2006-2007, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Why do biologists do what they do? How is biology actually done? In Thinking and Doing Biology students investigate the reasons biological science is done the way it is today. Students are given the opportunity to design and perform their own experiments while being taught the process of scientific investigation. Designed primarily for non-majors. Offered only during Interim. </p>
