	ART 225: Architectural Drawing and Design I
	(2013-2014, Semester 1)

<p> Through a sequence of architectural design projects, students learn drawing (hand drafting and computer-aided drawing and design) and architectural design processes that require the integration of social, artistic, technical, and environmental issues typical of real projects. Visiting architects are involved. Field trips to experience spaces/places augment the studio work. Prerequisite: Art 102 and Art 103 or equivalents or permission of instructor. Materials fee. Offered alternate years. </p>
