	ID 255: The Physician in Clinical and Hospital Health Care
	(2011-2012, Interim)
	</p>

	<p> Students will explore health care in a clinical and hospital setting through association with a     physician in one of the clinics that are a part of the metro area Fairview Health System or the     Family Practice Medical Center of Willmar, Minnesota.  Students will follow the physician, who      serves as their primary mentor, or other designated physicians through their daily activities in    pertinent clinical and hospital settings.  Students will observe the delivery of health care in     primary and specialty areas and in practices dealing with all age groups.  Emergency health care and physician support areas are other aspects of medicine to which students will be exposed.  Students  will keep a journal detailing their observations and their interpretation of and reaction to these  observations and will write a research paper on an aspect of current medical care and practice.     Selection is based on a review of all applicants (preference given to junior or senior pre-medical  students with demonstrated strong academic achievement).  P/N grading. Offered annually during      Interim. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration.                                            </p>
