	CLASS 122: Ghosts, Funerals, and Ferrymen: Death among the Ancient Greeks
	(2008-2009, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students receive grounding in Greek religion and in the variety of approaches used to study the classical world. Armed with evidence from art, archaeology, poetry, drama, history, curse tablets and religious rites, they explore the Greek view of mortality: What's a good death? What happens to the soul afterward? Can spirits intervene for the living? Where can you get a decent meal in Hades, and just how much is the ferryman charging these days. </p>
