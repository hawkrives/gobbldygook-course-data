	GERM 246: The Age of Goethe (in English)
	(2012-2013, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students examine the transformation of German political culture from feudal society to modern institutions of art, science, education and commerce. While the French Revolution (1789) is the historical axis on which this change turned, the life of Goethe (1749-1832) spans the period in which Germany made significant progress toward unity and democracy. Illustrative materials in digital and video form supplement the readings. May be counted toward German major or German studies concentration. </p>
