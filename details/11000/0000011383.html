	ENGL 252: Modern Irish Short Stories (abroad)
	(2005-2006, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students study modern Irish short stories in four distinct Irish settings (ancient city, coastal village, urban capital, lake-country town) where these stories were written. Reading, discussion and cultural experiences (including theater, museums and excursions by van) provide the basis for daily journal entries and several short papers. Offered alternate years during Interim. </p>
