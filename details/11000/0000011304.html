	ART 110: Foundation Perceptual and Conceptual Drawing
	(2005-2006, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces fundamental technical and perceptual skills of drawing, including the basic elements of mark, line, value, texture, form, space and their dynamics in composition. By translating observed subjects onto two-dimensional surfaces, students explore drawing as a means to self-expression, as a springboard to understanding how ideas are given visible form and as a cornerstone of artistic practice. Lab fee. </p>
