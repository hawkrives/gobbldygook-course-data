Economic and ethical                       perspectives on the value of ecosystems.                                                            (Social Science) - Bonnie Keeler</B>                                                                Ecosystems provide many benefits to people, including food, recreation, and the provision of        clean air and water. However, quantifying these benefits using traditional economic tools can be    challenging. Additionally, placing a monetary value on nature may lead to unintended                consequences. This course will explore the promise and potential pitfalls of economic               valuation of ecosystems goods and services. Specific topics will include non-market valuation       techniques, decision theory and risk analysis, ethical and equity issues surrounding                conservation, and historical perspectives on the environmental movement. Students will work         individually and in groups to address a series of case studies in conservation and                  environmental decision-making. Class sessions will include a combination of lecture, group          discussion, reading groups, and hands-on lab exercises using spatial models and decision            analysis techniques.                                                                                </p><p> <B>Environmental Studies 281B Top: Winter Ecology                                                   (Natural Science) - Charles Umbanhower, Jr.</B>                                                     Winter is an incredibly important time of year for plants, animals, and ecosystems in the           northern hemisphere. This course introduces the ecology of winter, and students learn about a       range of related topics including freeze tolerance and avoidance in plants and animals, energy      movement through snow and ice, and the impacts of freezing on soils and lakes. Students learn       through lectures, readings, laboratory work, and short field trips, as well as somes mall group     research projects. Prerequisite: Biology 125 and 126, or Chemistry/Biology 125-127 and Biology      126, or ES 137.                                                                                     </p>
