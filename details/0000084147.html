	EDUC 170: Urban Schools and Communities
	(2012-2013, Interim)
	</p>

	<p> In this course, students examine how schools and communities in the Twin Cities interact to         provide support and developmental opportunities for school-age children.  Through lectures,         readings, discussions, field trips, and in-school and co-curricular placements, students gain an    understanding and awareness of how race, class, ethnicity, national origin, and gender shape the    complex character of urban youth and schools.  Students spend one week in orientation               activities on campus and two weeks in the Twin Cities.  During the time in the Twin Cities, St. Olaf students participate as tutors and classroom assistants during the school day and then assist       in various after-school and community programs.  The last week of Interim is spent back on          campus discussing the experience.  Counts toward major: ARMS.  Counts toward concentration:         ARMS.  Fulfills Education 382: <I>Human Relations</I> requirement. Open to first-year students.     Offered during Interim. Counts towards ARMS and  American studies majors                            and ARMS concentration.                                                                             </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
