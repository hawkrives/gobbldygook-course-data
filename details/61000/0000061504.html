Diverse examples are drawn from literature -- <i>Love in the</i> <i> Driest Season</i>, <i>The Color of Water</i>, <i>A Poison Stronger than Love</i> -- and from students' autobiographies. Prerequisites: Sociology 121, Psychology 241, and Biology 123 or 243; open to non-majors by permission of program director only. Offered Fall Semester. </p><p> </p>
