	MATH 218: Geometry and Decorative Art in Morocco
	(2014-2015, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Islamic art is decorative and based on geometry. Students study this art, its origins, and its significance, along with cultural topics related to Moroccan life, in the imperial city of Fes. Field work includes identification and analysis of distinct geometrical patterns found on buildings, monuments, and artifacts. Students also use geometry to create their own art. Mosaic designs are still created in Fes, a center for Islamic geometric patterns. Students stay with Moroccan families while in Fes. Field trips visit sites in and around Fes, with day-long visits to Mekn√®s, Moulay Idriss, and Volubis, and a longer excursion to Marrakech and Casablanca. Offered periodically during Interim. </p>
