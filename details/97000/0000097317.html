	ENGL 276: Literature and the Environment
	(2014-2015, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Through nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, students explore the complex relations between humans and the "natural" world. Students consider questions such as the following: What does it mean to be connected to a landscape? What is a sense of place? Students also reflect on how they and the writers they read put landscape into language. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
