<p> This off-campus course examines historical memory through a charged set of public anniversaries in 2015. Students travel to the deep South to explore the public response to the region's history, particularly the civil rights movement, but also slavery and the Civil War. The course interrogates the public commemoration and museum displays dealing with anniversaries, specifically the Selma march of 1965. Students also examine contemporary recollections of eyewitnesses, and the discourse surrounding them now. Prerequisites: one course in sociology/anthropology, women's and gender studies, social work, family studies, economics, political science, environmental studies, or nursing. Counts toward history and American studies majors and race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Offered during Interim. </p>
