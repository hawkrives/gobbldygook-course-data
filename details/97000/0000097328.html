	PSYCH 338: Neurobiology of Psychopathology
	(2014-2015, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. In this discussion-based course, students use published research findings to examine the connections between the symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, biochemistry, and physiology. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230, PSYCH 247, plus PSYCH 238 or NEURO 239. Offered alternate years. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. </p><p> </p>
