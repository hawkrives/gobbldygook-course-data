	(2014-2015, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students study historical and contemporary realities of race, social class, health, welfare, and human rights in South Africa. This dynamic society provides unique opportunities to study the challenges and successes of inclusion, respect, and reconciliation in the post-Apartheid era. Students travel to three regions and meet with public, private, and community-based organizations. Special emphasis is on the status of women and children. Prerequisite: one course in political science, sociology/anthropology, social work, economics, psychology, family studies, or women's and gender studies. Offered occasionally during Interim. Counts toward Africa and the Americas and family studies concentrations. </p>
