	PSCI 252B: Politics and Development
	(2007-2008, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Some formerly developing countries have found the way to join the ranks of the industrialized nations, others have not. What explains the difference? By introducing students to theories of modernization, dependency, world systems, order, class, revolution, state, and political economy, the course attempts to provide the framework for answering this question. </p>
