	NORW 140: Norway: Continuity and Change
	(2007-2008, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Contemporary Norway is much more than lutefisk, lefse, Hardanger fiddles, rosemaling, and elaborate costumes. This course examines modern Norwegian society - imperfections and all - against the back-drop of tradition, looking at such issues as Norway's role in peace negotiations, its position as an outsider in Europe, and its evolving relationship with the United States. Taught in English. </p>
