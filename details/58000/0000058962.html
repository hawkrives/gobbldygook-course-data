	PSCI 264: Latin American Politics
	(2007-2008, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> How do the peoples of Latin America participate politically? How do domestic politics interact with national and international economics? How do states treat challenges posed by migration and by desires for "modernization" and democracy in a context of authoritarian legacy and debt? Students examine how Latin American politics work, focusing on Mexico, parts of Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean Region, and the Southern Cone. </p>
