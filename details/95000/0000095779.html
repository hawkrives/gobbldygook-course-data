	MATH 340: Complex Analysis
	(2014-2015, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Complex analysis treats the calculus of complex-valued functions of a complex variable. Familiar words and ideas from ordinary calculus (limit, derivative, integral, maximum and minimum, infinite series) reappear in the complex setting. Topics include complex mappings, derivatives, and integrals; applications focus especially on the physical sciences. Prerequisite: MATH 220, and MATH 226 or MATH 244. Offered annually. </p><p> </p>
