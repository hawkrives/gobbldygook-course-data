Examining the origin and evolution of vertebrates, comparing morphology across vertebrate taxa and examining selective factors leading to modern forms is of value to health science students, graduate studies in biology, and people who like dinosaurs. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: BIO 150 or BIO 126, or CH/BI 125, CHBI 126, and CH/BI 227 and BIO 126.
