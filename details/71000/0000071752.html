	ECON 219: Property and Vocation
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Property is the common fruit of humankind's vocational choices. Whether individuals pursue callings as Wall Street brokers or Peace Corps volunteers, they have to decide what to do with the property acquired through consumption, savings, and inheritance. By examining the historic and social development of property within the explicit context of vocation, students construct a meaningful relation to this important and pervasive cultural institution. Offered alternate Interims </p>
