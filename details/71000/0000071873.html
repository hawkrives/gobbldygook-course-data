	CLASS 121: "Western" Greeks and Eastern "Barbarians" in Antiquity
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces a variety of documents (both literary and artistic) to investigate cultural interactions between ancient Greece and the Near East. Students consider how the ancient Greeks related to the alien cultures with which they were in continual contact and how such cultural interactions involve both reciprocity and violence. What did it mean to be "Greek" or a "barbarian" in the ancient world? </p>
