	ASIAN 267: The Islamic Voice
	(2010-2011, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course focuses on the voice in the Islamic world, with a particular focus on Islam in Asia, in order to understand how Muslim believers express themselves through music. Beginning with the recitation of the Qur'an and the call to prayer, the course quickly moves to the different places these voices are heard. The course considers how the experience of Muslim music changes throughout time and space, and what unites these musical cultures. Students reflect on these questions through readings, listening, discussion, and writing. </p><p> </p>
