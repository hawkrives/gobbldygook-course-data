	ECON 242: Environmental Economics
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> The powerful insights of microeconomic analysis inform this consideration of environmental policy and regulation. Coursework emphasizes issues germane to setting and attaining specific environmental objectives - how much pollution to allow, how much to encourage preservation, how much cutting to permit. By considering whether and how to assign monetary values to goods like species diversity and climactic stability, students gain practical experience applying benefit-cost analysis to environmental decisions. Prerequisite: one of Economics 110-122 or consent of instructor. Offered annually. </p>
