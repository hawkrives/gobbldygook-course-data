	MATH 340: Complex Analysis
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Complex analysis is, roughly speaking, the calculus of complex-valued functions of a complex variable. Familiar words and ideas from ordinary calculus (limit, derivative, integral, maximum and minimum, infinite series) reappear in the complex setting. Topics include complex mappings, derivatives and integrals; applications focus especially on the physical sciences. Recommended for mathematicians, physicists and engineers. </p>
