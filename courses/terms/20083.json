Writers such as Dryden, Behn, Swift, Pope, and Fielding are read in the context of political and social revolutions, the African slave trade, and the growth of modern capitalism.\nThe Romantic Period considers the outburst of literary creativity in such poets as Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats and such prose writers as Wollstonecraft, Scott, Austen, and Mary Shelley, in the context of revolutionary politics, encounters with nature and the rise of industrialized, consumer capitalism.\nThe Victorian Period, a time of British political and cultural dominance, examines the work of such writers as Tennyson, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Dickens, and the Bront\u00ebs, in the context of scientific, industrial and colonial growth, religious skepticism, and challenges to class and gender inequalities.\nModern British Literature focuses on the literature reflecting modern turbulence, innovation, and alienation, as in Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, and Eliot, in the context of World War, social and economic crises, and radical artistic experimentalism.",

Students will be expected to take an active role in the seminar, which will include a research project on a topic relevant to the issues under discussion.\n392 B Development in Diverse Families How does development unfold within a variety of diverse family structures and contexts? Given demographic changes have made \"traditional\" middle-class, Euro-American, caregiver-mother-breadwinner-father, married, two-parent families increasingly unrepresentative of the population, we will explore parenting and child development across a variety of alternative family structures and sociocultural contexts, including primary caregiving fathers, divorced and remarried parents, and gay and lesbian parents. We will discuss similarities and variability across families and cultures, and unique challenges that \"nontraditional\" families may confront. Students will read and discuss scientific journal articles and book chapters, and bridge empirical research with popular culture and media portrayals of families. Prerequisite: Psychology 241.

Given demographic changes have made \"traditional\" middle-class, Euro-American, caregiver-mother-breadwinner-father, married, two-parent families increasingly unrepresentative of the population, we will explore parenting and child development across a variety of alternative family structures and sociocultural contexts, including primary caregiving fathers, divorced and remarried parents, and gay and lesbian parents.
