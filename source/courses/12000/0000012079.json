	"desc": "This course extends important ideas of single-variable calculus (derivatives, integrals, graphs, approximation, optimization, fundamental theorems, etc.) to higher-dimensional settings. These extensions make calculus tools far more powerful in modeling the (multi-dimensional) real world. Topics include partial derivatives, multiple integrals, transformations, Jacobians, line and surface integrals and the fundamental theorems of Green, Stokes and Gauss. Prerequisites: Mathematics 126 or 128, and 220. Offered both semesters.",
