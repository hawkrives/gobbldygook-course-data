	"desc": "This course examines how modern theories of chemical bonding are applied to an understanding of the chemistry of the elements of the periodic table. Students explore chemical structures, reactions and spectra on the basis of molecular symmetry and group theory. Topics covered include chemical periodicity, acid-base systems, coordination compounds, organometallic compounds, nonmetal chemistry and cluster compounds. Prerequisite: Chemistry 248.
