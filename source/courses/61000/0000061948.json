Students address personal sources of ideas, experimentation, drawing skills and compositional concerns and draw upon examples of master printmakers to discuss how images reflect culture. Critical thinking skills are necessary in discussion and critiques. Prerequisites: Art 102 or Art 111 and 112 (or 110). Materials fee. Offered annually.",
