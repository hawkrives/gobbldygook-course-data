	"desc": "This course traces the path of invertebrate evolution from single-celled protozoans to the most primitive chordates. Emphasis is placed upon major breakthroughs in design which enable organisms to exploit new ecological habitats. Laboratories are designed to provide students with first-hand lab and field research experiences and use of video-microscopy facilities. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Taught annually. Prerequisites: Biology 125 and 126.",
