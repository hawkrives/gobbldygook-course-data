	"desc": "This class explores the connection between Christian belief and its power to shape social and political action. Questions at the heart of thinking about Christian belief and social action include: How does Christian faith matter for one's actions in the world? What reasoning, sources, and argumentation from the Christian tradition are used as a critique for contemporary social issues? What role is Christian belief to play in the wider world? The course examines these questions through readings, class sessions, and each student's involvement in some form of civic engagement. Prerequisite: BTS-B. Offered periodically during Interim.",
