Topics include pain management, sleep and rest, diabetes, antiinfectives, and perioperative care. Students apply the nursing process to the care of adults, with emphasis on the elderly.

Clinical experiences are provided in a variety of settings serving adult and elderly populations, as well as in simulation. Prerequisites: concurrent registration in NURS 302, NURS 304, and NURS 306.
