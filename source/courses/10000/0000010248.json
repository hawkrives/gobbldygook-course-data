	"desc": "This course explores the arts and architecture of western Europe from c. 300 to c. 1300. Through lectures and discussions we study paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, metalwork and stained glass windows created by the many cultures of this rich and diverse period in the history of art. Students approach the material in a variety of ways: in addition to issues of style, technique and iconography, students address issues of viewing, patronage and gender throughout the semester.",
