	"desc": "Neurons form the basis of cellular communication in the central nervous system, and the synapses through which this communication occurs are highly plastic and subject to alterations by environmental factors such as learning, inflammation, stress, and drugs. This course investigates how changes in synaptic signaling can ultimately give rise to the expression of a variety of behaviors and psychopathologies. Class work includes presenting, writing about, and discussing a number of journal articles, literature reviews, and texts. Prerequisites: Biology 125, or Chemistry/Biology 125-127, and progress towards a major in any of the natural sciences.",
