The course is well suited for students of biology or chemistry or for those desiring a thorough introduction beyond the high school level. Physics 124 takes up the Newtonian mechanics of point particles (motion, mass, force, torque, energy, momentum, and gravitation), Einstein's reexamination of space time (relativity), and nuclear physics. One laboratory per week. Prerequisite: MATH 119 or MATH 120 or equivalent. Offered annually in the fall semester.",
