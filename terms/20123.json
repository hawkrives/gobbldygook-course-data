Banks and his five dimensions of multicultural education (content integration, the knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, an equity pedagogy, and an empowering school culture and social structure) serve as the conceptual model for the course.

In what ways have multicultural education and critical pedagogy successfully addressed issues of inequity in public education? In society? What might a new model for the 21st century look like?",
