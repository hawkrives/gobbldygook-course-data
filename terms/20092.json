But all of these writers can be seen as entering into a conversation or debate with one another about the possibilities--or lack thereof--of attaining personal freedom and reforming American life.

Returning to The French Lieutenant's Woman after exploring this larger context of history, fiction, art, criticism, and theory, we will ask: What difference does this body of knowledge make in our experience of the novel? How does intertextuality - a text's network of relationships with other texts - work? We will also consider postmodernism and its take on history and intertextuality, ideas about the 'ideal reader' or 'implied audience,' sex and sexuality in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, and a deep twentieth-century fascination with the Victorian era.
